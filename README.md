# GitHub Launcher Mac — GitOpsGarage

A maintained macOS fork of [SirDiabo/GithubLauncher](https://github.com/SirDiabo/GithubLauncher).
This fork is maintained by GitOpsGarage; it is not an upstream-endorsed release.
The original MIT license and project attribution are preserved.

## macOS support

- Self-contained Apple Silicon and Intel builds using Avalonia/.NET 9.
- Native macOS releases take priority; each game can explicitly select its Windows build.
- A release audit covers the full bundled catalog, including Twilight Princess
  (Dusklight), Wind Waker HD, and Spider-Man: Edge of Time Recompiled.
- Filters distinguish **Mac build available**, **Gameplay tested**, **Windows candidates**,
  and **Unassessed**. **Only playable results** requires documented gameplay for the release
  and asset on the current architecture/macOS and runtime. Published builds are not gameplay ratings.
- Native ZIP, TAR.GZ, TAR.XZ, TGZ, and DMG installation preserves complete payloads,
  including tools/SDKs stored beside an app bundle.
- Windows games can use direct CrossOver bottles or Steam / NotProton shortcuts.
  Steam receives the actual Windows executable and selected installed NotProton tool.
  Unverified Windows builds require explicit per-game testing opt-in.
- Record **Playable**, **Playable with adjustments**, or **Unsupported** separately
  for native Mac, direct CrossOver, and Steam / NotProton. Updates require fresh tests.
- Settings, library, cache, and default installs live outside the app bundle.

See [MACOS.md](MACOS.md) for builds, game setup, data locations, and limitations.
The launcher downloads and manages projects; it does not supply original game data.

[NotProton](https://github.com/NotProtonNot/NotProton) enables Steam Play in the macOS
Steam client using CrossOver. Install and configure it separately, then use
**Configure Mac launch… → Steam / NotProton → Prepare in Steam** with Steam closed.
The launcher backs up Steam configuration before registering the shortcut and tool.
Gameplay reports stay local; this fork does not claim Valve certification or supply
pre-certified Windows games. Submit reproducible reports through the fork's
[compatibility report form](https://github.com/GitOpsGarage/GithubLauncher/issues/new?template=mac-compatibility.yml).

## Development and commits

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/GitOpsGarage/GithubLauncher.git
cd GithubLauncher
bundle install
bundle exec overcommit --install
bundle exec overcommit --sign
bundle exec overcommit --sign pre-commit
bash scripts/check.sh
bash scripts/build-macos.sh osx-arm64
```

Every commit must pass Overcommit. Do not bypass hooks. CI also runs the same checks
before producing Mac artifacts. Run `python3 scripts/audit-mac-catalog.py` with an
authenticated GitHub CLI to refresh bundled release evidence. GitHub API discovery
in the app preserves cached results when offline or rate limited.

>## Important
>### Migration from N64RecompLauncher to GithubLauncher
>
>This software was previously knows as the "N64Recomp Launcher", but this had to be changed due to continued requests by the N64Recomp Tool Developers. If you are interested in a version of the launcher that is primarily for N64 Recompiled Games, then check out [this version](https://github.com/SirDiabo/GithubLauncher/releases/tag/v1.70).
>You can then go into the `update_check.json` and change the year in `LastCheckTime` to something like `9999` to disable self-updates.
>
>If you have an old version, and wish to update to the newer ones, you will have to update manually by dragging the new files into your launcher folder. You can then delete all files with "N64Recomp" in their names.
>Your settings will remain compatible.

- **App Management**: Easy-to-use interface for launching GitHub-hosted apps
- **Smart Integration**: Direct integration with GitHub releases for smooth updates

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9 Runtime (get it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/))
- Internet connection for updates and downloads

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/GitOpsGarage/GithubLauncher/releases) page
2. Extract the downloaded archive to your preferred location
3. Run the executable.

## Usage

1. Launch the application
2. The launcher will automatically check for updates on startup
3. Browse your app library through the interface
4. Select an app and click "Download/Launch" to use it

## Configuration

### GitHub API Token
To avoid hitting GitHub's API rate limits, you can provide a personal access token.
Create a token with no special permissions needed and set it in the launcher settings.
You can create a token at ```GitHub Settings -> Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic) > Generate new token```
You don't need to give it any special permissions. Then paste that Token into your Settings field. Do not share your Token!

### apps.json Structure

The launcher uses an `apps.json` file to manage the available apps. Every entry is user-managed and editable; there are no built-in stable, experimental, or custom categories.

#### App Entry Properties

Each app entry requires the following properties:

- **`name`** - The display name of the app as it appears in the launcher
- **`repository`** - The GitHub repository in the format `username/repository`
- **`folderName`** - The folder name where the app will be downloaded and installed
- **`appIconUrl`** - URL of the app's icon image. If null, a default icon will be used.

#### Example Configuration

```json
{
    "apps": [
        {
            "name": "Example App",
            "repository": "username/example-app-repo",
            "folderName": "ExampleApp",
            "appIconUrl": null
        },
        {
            "name": "Another App",
            "repository": "anotheruser/another-app-repo",
            "folderName": "AnotherApp",
            "appIconUrl": "link/to/an/image.png"
        }
    ]
}
```
